A quick summary on the research projects I'm working on. I will also try to upload my latest CV here.

## How socioeconomic status influences the neurodevelopment of the limbic system

Neuroscientists have been trying to identify the biological mechanisms through which socioeconomic factors influence the development of the brain, with the hope that understanding these neurobiological effects will help us explain and remediate the effects of socioeconomic disadvantages.
