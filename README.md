A quick summary on the research projects I'm working on. You can also find my CV here.

## How socioeconomic status influences the neurodevelopment of the limbic system 
Lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse academic achievements and mental health outcomes. Neuroscientists have been trying to identify the biological mechanisms through which socioeconomic factors influence the development of the brain, with the hope that understanding these neurobiological effects will help us explain and remediate the effects of socioeconomic disadvantages.

One prevalent theory proposes that socioeconomic factors disproportionately impacts the development of the hippocampus and the amygdala through stress. My current research project examines this stress hypothesis by testing whether these two brain regions are disproportionately affected by socioeconomic factors.
